            <p class="career"><strong>Career Goals:</strong></p>
            <p class="content1">Iâ€™ve always been driven by curiosity and the desire to build things that matter. Alongside my studies, I explore cybersecurity independently through TryHackMe, where Iâ€™m developing strong foundations in offensive security and penetration testing, skills I plan to refine throughout my career.</p>
            <p class="content2">Beyond cybersecurity, I love turning ideas into real prototypes. One of my ongoing personal projects is a physical alarm clock built on a Raspberry Pi. It plays a custom song chosen through a web interface â€” a small but fun challenge that blends web development, networking, and embedded systems.</p>
            <p class="content3">Iâ€™m also involved as a contributor for my schoolâ€™s Junior Enterprise, which gives me the opportunity to work on real projects for clients and share my knowledge with others. These experiences help me connect technical curiosity with real-world impact.</p>
            <p class="content4">More recently, Iâ€™ve been working with a close friend on the early stages of a startup idea. Weâ€™re still exploring the concept and direction, but this journey fuels my interest in innovation, teamwork, and building something meaningful from scratch.</p>
            <p class="conclusion">Ultimately, I see my future as a cybersecurity engineer who combines technical expertise with creativity and initiative â€” someone who doesnâ€™t just analyze systems, but designs and improves them.</p>
